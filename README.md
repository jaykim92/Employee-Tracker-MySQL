# Employee-Tracker-MySQL
## Description
This app allows for a user to manage a list of employees through a command line interface. The app was built using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges for this homework was organization. I used many lines of code for the functionality of this app and they are currently all on one line. I hope to be able to become more familiar with separating my code into different files for future projects like this.

Another big challenge for me was conceptualizing the JOIN of two tables in MySQL and using all of the keywords to pull the exact columns and rows from a specific table.

There is definitely many lines of code that I would like to refactor in the future, but I did try and write code in different ways to use for reference in the future.
